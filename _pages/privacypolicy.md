## 1. Personal Data Collection

RunBuddy does not require personal or sensitive user data to function. However, users may choose to provide information in the following ways:  

- **Report a Problem**: Users may submit diagnostics, attach a backup file, include screenshots or photos, and optionally provide their name and email address.  
- **Suggest an Improvement**: Users may provide their name, email address, and details of their suggestion.  
- **Analytics and Diagnostics**: RunBuddy integrates with **Google Analytics for Firebase**, which may collect crash data, performance data, product interaction, and other usage or diagnostic data.  

## 2. Data Usage

- **App Functionality**: Information submitted through *Report a Problem* or *Suggest an Improvement* is used only to investigate and resolve the reported issue, or to review and consider user suggestions. Attached backups may also be used internally to test new features and improvements.  
- **Analytics**: Data from Google Analytics for Firebase is used to monitor crashes, performance, and general usage trends to improve app reliability and user experience.  

## 3. Storage and Security

- All app data remains stored locally on the user’s device unless:  
  - the user explicitly chooses to submit diagnostics, backups, screenshots, photos, or contact details, or  
  - the user enables **iCloud backup or storage**, in which case data is securely stored in their iCloud account under Apple’s policies.  
- Submitted information is treated as confidential and is not shared with third parties. It is retained only for as long as necessary to resolve the issue or review the suggestion.  

## 4. User Consent

- By downloading and using RunBuddy, you consent to the integration of Google Analytics for Firebase.  
- Submitting a problem report, diagnostic file, backup, screenshot, photo, or improvement suggestion is entirely optional and requires explicit user action.  
- Users can withdraw consent by discontinuing use of the app or refraining from submitting optional information.  

## 5. Third-Party Services

RunBuddy integrates with:  
- **Google Analytics for Firebase**: Collects crash data, performance data, product interaction, other usage data, and other diagnostic data. This information is linked to the user’s identity and may be used for app functionality and analytics. Data is subject to [Google’s Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy).  
- **Apple iCloud** (optional): If enabled by the user, app data may be backed up or stored in iCloud and is subject to [Apple’s Privacy Policy](https://www.apple.com/legal/privacy/).  

No other third-party integrations are used.
